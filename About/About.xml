  <description>Imagine that you live under a dictatorship where no opposition is tolerated, the media is a mass propaganda machine, and the independent judiciary system is a sad joke.\n\nYour country’s abundant resources, the army, and, more importantly, your gender have been used to oppress you as hard as possible.\n\nWhat would you do? How would you fight for your fundamental rights?\n\nWith unbelievable bravery, the young women in Iran are fighting empty-handed with this ruthless dictatorship, risking their lives.\n\nI invite you to hear their voice and shout out with them: Woman, Life, Freedom.</description>
