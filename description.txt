[h1]Woman Life Freedom[/h1]
Support the women of Iran in their fight for freedom and equality. Subscribe to this mod to help us raise awareness.
[h2]Background[/h2]
Imagine that you live under a dictatorship where no opposition is tolerated, the media is a mass propaganda machine, and the independent judiciary system is a sad joke.

Your countryâ€™s abundant resources, the army, and, more importantly, your gender have been used to oppress you as hard as possible.

What would you do? How would you fight for your fundamental rights?

With unbelievable bravery, the young women in Iran are fighting empty-handed with this ruthless dictatorship, risking their lives.

I invite you to hear their voice and shout out with them: Woman, Life, Freedom.
[h2]What this mod does[/h2]
This mod parallels the bravery of Iranian women in their fight against oppression.

In game, any factions with ideologies that force women to cover their faces and hair will be affected by this mod. Instead of the women getting the usual mood buf from being covered, this mod will instead make the women very angry with their apparel.

There is a simple fix. Remove their covering apparel and they will be happy again.
[h2]Why we made this mod?[/h2]
I created this mod with my Iranian partner to raise awareness of an issue that we care about. Rimworlds ideologies contain great depth for exploring issues like this. As an experienced modder, I was in a unique position to create a mod that would make the player think about this real world issue.
